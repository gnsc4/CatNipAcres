                        <li><strong>Dignity</strong> - Ensuring your pet's comfort and dignity throughout the process</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Is your pet experiencing pain that cannot be adequately managed?</li>
                        <li>Can they enjoy the activities that once brought them joy?</li>
                        <li>Are they able to eat, drink, and eliminate normally?</li>
                        <li>Do they recognize and interact with family members?</li>

                    <h3>How will I know when it's the right time?</h3>
                    <p>This is a deeply personal decision. Many pet owners find it helpful to consider their pet's quality of life, including ability to eat, move, and engage with family. Our veterinarians can help assess your pet's condition and discuss options, but ultimately, you know your pet best. We often say it's better to say goodbye a week too early than a day too late.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens during the euthanasia procedure?</h3>
                    <p>Your pet will first receive a sedative to help them relax and feel comfortable. Once they're relaxed, the veterinarian will administer the euthanasia solution, which is an overdose of an anesthetic agent. This causes the heart and breathing to stop peacefully, usually within seconds. The process is painless and similar to going under anesthesia.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I stay with my pet during euthanasia?</h3>
                    <p>This is entirely your choice. Many pet owners choose to stay to comfort their pet in their final moments, while others find it too emotionally difficult. There is no right or wrong decision, and our staff will support whatever you choose. Your pet will be treated with compassion and dignity either way.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long will it take to receive my pet's ashes?</h3>
                    <p>For private cremation, it typically takes 7-10 business days for ashes to be returned. We'll contact you when your pet's remains are ready to be picked up. For communal cremation, ashes are not returned.</p>

                    <h3>How can I help my other pets cope with the loss?</h3>
                    <p>Other pets in the household may experience grief when a companion animal passes. They may search for their friend, show decreased appetite, or become more clingy. Maintaining routines, providing extra attention, and patience can help them adjust. Some pets may benefit from seeing their deceased companion's body to understand what happened.</p>
